# Zhao Xintong becomes the most complicated world champion in snooker history

Zhao Xintong 18-12 Mark Williams: Zhao demolished three-time winner Williams to become China’s first world champion but his complex past means that accomplishment comes with questions

The long-overdue moment that a first Chinese winner of the World Snooker Championship finally arrived was supposed to be one of unalloyed joy. Yet now it’s here, there is an air of hesitancy around the celebrations – entirely because the man in question is Zhao Xintong.

Snooker is already a huge deal in China, with a market of 1.4 billion people dwarfing the traditional hotbeds of this still quaintly British sport, but having their own world champion has always been touted as the occurrence that would send it stratospheric.

The Asian powerhouse has been visited by snooker since its cultural heyday in the 1980s but it wasn’t until the emergence of Ding Junhui in the mid-2000s that the country had its own star to root for. Ding became a national superstar, hoovered up ranking events, won triple crown tournaments and was long predicted to become the first Chinese world champion, although a loss to Mark Selby in the 2016 final remains his best effort at the Crucible.

Instead, it is Zhao who takes the coveted mantle. The 28-year-old from Xi’an cut a swathe through qualifying and the main stage of the World Championship to set up a final against Mark Williams, the laid-back Welshman gunning for his fourth Crucible title and trying to become the oldest world champion in history at the age of 50.

His talent and class on the table are without question. His fluent, left-handed style has earned him comparisons with six-time world finalist Jimmy White. Those are apt but, borrowing the caveat used about him when he’s in the balls. The smoothness when striking the cueball, the attacking verve, the aggressive shot selection all have shades of “The Rocket”, so perhaps it’s no surprise that the 49-year-old has been something of a mentor

But it’s his actions off the table that make Zhao such a complex figure. He was competing in Sheffield this fortnight as an amateur due to only recently returning from a 20-month ban for match-fixing.

The high-profile saga engulfed snooker in early 2023 as 10 Chinese players were charged with varying degrees of match-fixing, and ultimately Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were banned from the sport for life.

It is worth repeating that Zhao did not personally fix any matches – hence his punishment being on the more lenient end of the scale – but he was found guilty of being party to another player fixing two matches and betting on snooker matches himself. He saw a 30-month suspension reduced to 20 months following early admissions and a guilty plea.
